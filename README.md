lox
====

`lox` is the tree-walk interpreter from the [Crafting Interpreters] book.

Goal
-----------------

I will be using this repository to recreate projects in [Crafting Interpreters] in different programming languages.

Plan is to implement jlox(Java) and clox(C) by following the book. Then implement the rust version, and go from there.
